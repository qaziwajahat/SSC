We will also be working tirelessly with our community to guarantee our social media platforms are at a high aesthetic standard and create new concepts over time.

                                    Through careful and detailed design guidance, we will make sure to create unique statement items before, during, and after the launch of this drop. You can already see some of the pieces on our Shiba...

                                    As a member of the Shiba Social Club, YOU will have the opportunity to submit a project idea, and the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) that is created will vote on which project to launch!

                                    As we all know, Shiba Social Club is exactly that: a social club! We want to hang out! So, we will be hosting IRL events for our holders. The first event will take place 1 month after the drop, and the community will vote to choose the location between different cities in the world.

                                    After discussion with some of the most influential people in the NFT and Crypto industry, we are currently working to bring them to the events. But shhhh. Let's keep it secret for the moment ðŸ˜‰

                                    All events will be private, only for our holders. Food and drinks will be provided for all holders. Legendary holders will be invited to events with an all inclusive package (flight, hotel, food, drinks and special activities). Imagine yourself with all Shiba members, holding a glass of champagne and hanging out with celebrities.

                                    Since we know that some of our Club Members will not be able to attend, we will broadcast all of our events LIVE, and soon in the metaverse...

                                    To reach our goal, we'll do massive marketing campaigns in the biggest cities in the world. We need to be seen everywhere (Airport, Taxi, Subway).
